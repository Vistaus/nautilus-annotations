Please bear in mind that this CSS affects the entire screen, not just the
annotations window, so be careful with wildcard selectors.

This CSS overrides themes' styles. If you want to create a custom CSS for this
extension consider to add it to a theme instead of editing this file.

For information about Nautilus Annotations' DOM tree and all available
selectors please refer to `/usr/share/doc/nautilus-annotations/styling.md`.

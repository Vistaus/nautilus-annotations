## 1.0.0

* The extension can be considered stable enough; the version string has been
  updated to 1.0.0


## 0.10.0

* The extension has been ported to `libnautilus-extension-4`


## 0.9.0

* The `notebook-double-margin` CSS theme, consisting in a symmetric version of
  the `notebook` theme, has been added to the repository


## 0.8.0

* A selection of CSS themes has been created and the `notebook` theme has been
  chosen as the default theme
* It is now possible to override the system-wide CSS
  (`/usr/share/nautilus-annotations/style.css`) by placing a CSS in the home
  directory (`~/.local/share/nautilus-annotations/style.css`) -- the extension
  checks in the home directory first, if no theme is found it falls back to the
  default CSS
* A `with-theme=...` option has been added to the `configure` script for
  selecting a different CSS theme during the build process; with this comes a
  `--without-theme` option too, for relying solely on the current GTK theme and
  not using any extension-specific one
* Internationalization does not depend on **XDG intltool** anymore, but only on
  **GNU gettext**


## 0.7.0

* An "Annotations" column has been added to Nautilus' list view


## 0.6.0

* Two new keyboard shortcuts have been created (`Ctrl` + `S` and `Shift` +
  `Esc`)
* All keyboard shortcuts -- both inherited and extension-specific ones -- are
  now documented in `/usr/share/doc/nautilus-annotations/shortcuts.md`


## 0.5.0

* The action button in the annotations window has been moved to the header bar
* The file's path has become the window's subtitle


## 0.4.1

* Annotations window's default width has become bigger


## 0.4.0

  currently displayed
* The home path in the window's title is now replaced with a tilde
* Multiple actions, when available, are now gathered in one single sub-menu
* Automatic text wrapping has been added to the text area (long lines are
  broken in between words)
* The confirmation dialog windows for destructive actions have been decorated
  according to Nautilus' style


## 0.3.0

  (`/usr/share/nautilus-annotations/style.css`)

Nautilus Annotations
====================

Annotate files and directories


Details
-------

Long time ago **GNOME Files** (**Nautilus**) had the ability to handle custom
annotations attached to files and directories. This ability has slowly gone
lost in the folds of time. Things however are rarely really unlearned, and an
ability rarely goes away for good.

**Nautilus Annotations** brings back **Nautilus**' annotation capabilities. It
exploits the same machinery that was used back then: that of relying on **GIO**
to store custom information about a file or a directory.

Each annotation is stored as a `metadata::annotation` entry in **GIO**'s
database. Annotated files are shown in the viewport with an emblem attached.

To erase an annotation it is sufficient to leave the content blank, and the
extension will take care of erasing the database entry.

The dialog window for editing the annotations is very minimal, albeit polished
and with Markdown highlighting enabled.

Thanks to **GIO**, when a file is moved or renamed its annotations remain
synchronized with the new path.

Annotations are “per user”. That means that although Alice has the right to
annotate Bob's files, only Alice will have access to her own annotations.

Emblems are displayed by the extension and will not be shown once the extension
is uninstalled (the `metadata::emblems` database entry for the file is left
untouched). The content of the annotations instead is managed by **GIO** and
will survive uninstalling the extension.

Annotations are stored under `~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata`. It is possible to
access them via command line by launching:

``` sh
gio info -a 'metadata::annotation' /path/to/file
```

To set an annotation via command line launch:

``` sh
gio set /path/to/file 'metadata::annotation' 'Content of annotation goes here'
```

To unset an annotation via command line launch:

``` sh
gio set -t unset /path/to/file 'metadata::annotation'
```


Get involved
------------

The package needs help with internationalization. If a translation into your
language is missing and you wish to get involved, here is what to do.

Let's say you want to create a Dutch translation of **Nautilus Annotations**.
The extension comes with only a bunch of strings to translate. First thing to
do is to make sure that `gettext` and `intltool` are installed on your system.
Then clone this repository and launch the following four commands:

``` sh
cd nautilus-annotations/po
intltool-update -p --gettext-package=nautilus-annotations
msginit -l nl
rm nautilus-annotations.pot
```

Now edit the `po/LINGUAS` file and add a new line containing the abbreviated
name of the new language (`nl`).

Finally, open the `po/nl.po` file and translate the strings present. All you
have to do now is to commit your changes.

If you want to update an existing Dutch translation to the most recent changes
in the extension source code, launch

``` sh
cd nautilus-annotations/po
intltool-update -p --gettext-package=nautilus-annotations
mv nl.po nl.po.bak && msgmerge nl.po.bak nautilus-annotations.pot > nl.po
rm nautilus-annotations.pot nl.po.bak
```

For any issue, [drop me a message][1].


Installation
------------

On most Unix-like systems, you should be able to install this package using the
following common steps:

``` sh
./configure
make
make install-strip
```

If the `strip` utility is not available on your machine, use `make install`
instead (it will produce larger binaries).

If the `configure` script is missing from your package you need to generate it
by running the `bootstrap` script. By default, `bootstrap` will also run the
`configure` script immediately after having generated it, so you may type the
`make` command directly after `bootstrap`. To list different options use
`./bootstrap --help`.

For further information, see [INSTALL][2].
